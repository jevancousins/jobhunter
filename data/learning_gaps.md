## Skills to Learn

### High Priority (for AI/ML & Data Science roles)

- [ ] **PyTorch** - ML framework alternative to TensorFlow, widely requested
- [ ] **Docker** - Containerisation, critical for AI/ML deployment roles
- [ ] **Kubernetes basics** - Container orchestration, often paired with Docker
- [ ] **Hugging Face Transformers** - Open-source models, essential for LLM work

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Polars** - Modern Pandas alternative, faster for large datasets
- [ ] **Flask or Django** - Broader web framework knowledge beyond FastAPI
- [ ] **Airflow** - Workflow orchestration for data engineering
- [ ] **dbt** - Data transformation tool, common in analytics engineering

## Certifications to Pursue

| Certification | Provider | Relevance | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty | AWS | High for AI/ML | Industry-recognised |
| Azure AI Engineer Associate | Microsoft | High | Aligns with Azure experience |
| Google Cloud Professional ML Engineer | GCP | Medium | Alternative to AWS |
| CFA Level 1 | CFA Institute | Medium for Quant | Adds finance credibility |

## Quant Methods to Study

These gaps were identified during CV optimisation interview:

- [ ] **Time series analysis** - ARIMA, forecasting methods
- [ ] **Monte Carlo simulation** - Risk modelling applications
- [ ] **Portfolio optimisation theory** - Mean-variance, efficient frontier
- [ ] **Backtesting frameworks** - Zipline, Backtrader, or custom

## Current Skill Confidence Levels

### Interview-Ready
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, FastAPI)
- SQL (complex queries, window functions, CTEs)
- LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI API, Claude API
- Power BI, DAX
- SwiftUI, iOS development
- Regression analysis, hypothesis testing

### Can Discuss but Not Deep
- R (basic usage)
- VBA (automation scripts)
- Statistical modelling fundamentals

### University Exposure Only
- MATLAB (removed from CV - not interview-confident)

### Removed from CV
- Wolfram (not interview-ready)

## Notes

- This file should be updated whenever gaps are identified during:
  - CV optimisation sessions
  - Job description analysis
  - Interview preparation
  - Skills assessments

- Priority should be based on:
  1. Frequency of appearance in target job descriptions
  2. Alignment with strategic career direction (AI/ML focus)
  3. Time investment required vs. return
