% Formula: Background + Key Achievement (quantified) + Target Role

Technical implementation specialist with a strong analytical foundation from UCL (Physics and Mathematics). At Allianz Global Investors, I led the successful delivery of MSCI BarraOne across global Fixed Income teams---completing a transformation that had failed twice previously over seven years. I thrive at the intersection of technology and client needs, translating complex requirements into scalable solutions. Seeking a Client Solutions or Implementation role where I can drive successful system deployments and deliver measurable value to clients.
