Software engineer with a Physics and Mathematics background from UCL, experienced in building full-stack applications and data systems. Developing two iOS apps: Lineup (concert tracking with multi-source data pipeline aggregating 6 APIs) and NutriPlan (AI-powered meal planning with FastAPI backend). At Allianz Global Investors, I engineered automated workflows and 20+ production reports using Python, SQL and Power BI, saving £500,000+ in costs.
